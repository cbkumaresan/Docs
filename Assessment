Step 1: Assessment and Discovery is a crucial phase in implementing Dynatrace for monitoring your application architecture and infrastructure. During this phase, you need to gather information to ensure a comprehensive understanding of your environment and make sure that no critical components are left out of monitoring. Below is a detailed breakdown of the key details and questions you should ask while conducting this assessment and discovery:

1. Application Architecture Assessment
Questions to Ask:
What are the core applications that require monitoring?
Identify all applications that are critical to business functions.
Determine whether these applications are monolithic, microservices-based, or serverless.
What programming languages and frameworks are used?
(e.g., Java, .NET, Python, Node.js, Ruby)
Are any third-party libraries or dependencies critical to application performance?
How are the applications deployed?
On-premises, cloud-based (AWS, Azure, GCP), or hybrid environment?
Containerized (Docker, Kubernetes), VM-based, or serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda)?
What type of architecture is employed?
Monolithic, microservices, event-driven, serverless, or multi-tiered?
Are there any custom-built applications that need special monitoring?
Identify applications with custom logic or workflows that might require specialized monitoring (e.g., custom APIs).
Key Areas to Investigate:
Understand the flow of data and transactions across the application stack.
Identify entry points and critical business transactions (e.g., user login, payment processing, etc.).
Assess integration points (APIs, external services, third-party integrations) that need to be monitored.
2. Infrastructure Assessment
Questions to Ask:
What infrastructure components are used to host the applications?
On-premises servers, virtual machines (VMs), or cloud services?
Cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or hybrid infrastructure?
What is the current configuration of the underlying infrastructure?
Hardware specifications (CPU, RAM, storage).
Network infrastructure (bandwidth, latency, firewalls, load balancers, etc.).
How are the resources provisioned?
Are there auto-scaling capabilities in place for managing workloads (cloud or container orchestration tools like Kubernetes)?
Is resource utilization elastic or fixed?
What databases are in use?
RDBMS (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server) or NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra)?
Where are these databases hosted (on-prem, cloud)?
What kind of database interactions are important (query latency, connection pooling, etc.)?
Key Areas to Investigate:
Assess the infrastructure hosting critical components like load balancers, caches (e.g., Redis), and message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ).
Understand infrastructure redundancy and high availability measures (backup systems, failover, disaster recovery).
3. Key Services Identification
Questions to Ask:
What are the key business services or endpoints that require monitoring?
Identify services that directly impact business operations or customer experience.
What kind of user or customer traffic patterns are present?
Peak traffic times, geographical distribution of users.
Are there any SLAs or KPIs tied to service performance (e.g., uptime, latency, response time)?
What are the critical APIs that need to be monitored?
Are there internal APIs (microservices) or external API dependencies that need performance tracking?
Key Areas to Investigate:
Identify mission-critical services and endpoints that drive customer engagement (e.g., payment gateways, order processing, authentication services).
Investigate any services prone to performance degradation or instability during peak loads.
4. Cloud Services and Integration Points
Questions to Ask:
Which cloud services are you utilizing?
Services like AWS Lambda, RDS, S3, Azure App Services, GCP BigQuery, etc.
Are you using PaaS (Platform as a Service) or IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)?
What third-party integrations exist?
Identify any third-party services that are critical for application functionality (e.g., payment services, content delivery networks).
What kind of cloud automation tools are in place?
Auto-scaling policies, CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration, etc.
Key Areas to Investigate:
Check for specific monitoring needs in cloud environments, such as auto-scaling, cloud-based databases (e.g., AWS RDS, Azure SQL), and security controls (e.g., identity management, encryption).
5. Performance and Availability Requirements
Questions to Ask:
What are the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the application?
Response time, transaction processing time, availability (uptime), throughput, latency.
What is the desired level of uptime?
Define SLAs (Service Level Agreements) for different services (e.g., 99.9% uptime).
What thresholds trigger alerts or escalation?
Define thresholds for CPU, memory usage, error rates, slow transactions, etc.
What load testing or stress testing has been performed?
Are there known bottlenecks or performance issues under heavy load?
Key Areas to Investigate:
Performance metrics for key application functions and infrastructure components.
Look into capacity planning and current system limitations under stress conditions.
6. Database Monitoring Requirements
Questions to Ask:
What databases are critical to the application's performance?
Identify databases like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, etc.
How does the application interact with the databases?
Query patterns (complex joins, read-heavy or write-heavy operations).
Are there existing issues with database performance?
Slow queries, deadlocks, connection pooling problems, cache misses.
Key Areas to Investigate:
Database query execution times, latency, and throughput.
Connection pool usage, slow query identification, and replication lag.
7. Security and Compliance Considerations
Questions to Ask:
Are there any security or compliance requirements?
Compliance with standards like GDPR, PCI-DSS, HIPAA.
Data encryption needs, role-based access control (RBAC), etc.
What sensitive data needs to be protected?
Identify sensitive data that should be masked or anonymized in logs and traces.
What security protocols are in place?
SSL/TLS encryption, firewall rules, identity and access management (IAM).
Key Areas to Investigate:
Monitor security events such as failed logins, suspicious transactions, and audit logs.
Check for vulnerabilities, configuration errors, or misconfigurations.
8. Real User Monitoring (RUM) and User Experience
Questions to Ask:
Who are the end-users of the application (internal or external)?
Identify user personas and the geographic distribution of users.
What devices and platforms do users access the application from?
Desktop, mobile, tablet, different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
What are the critical user journeys to monitor?
User login, checkout process, search functionality, etc.
How are you currently tracking user experience?
Any existing tools like Google Analytics, browser-based monitoring, or server-side monitoring?
Key Areas to Investigate:
Monitor page load times, error rates, user session durations, and bounce rates.
Segment monitoring by device type, browser, and geographic region to uncover UX issues.
9. Existing Monitoring and Tooling
Questions to Ask:
Do you currently have any monitoring tools in place?
Existing APM, infrastructure, or log monitoring tools (e.g., New Relic, Datadog, Prometheus).
What gaps are present in the current monitoring setup?
Missing services or lack of real-time monitoring capabilities?
How are logs, metrics, and traces being captured?
Centralized logging systems (e.g., ELK stack), time-series databases (e.g., Prometheus), trace aggregation (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin).
Key Areas to Investigate:
Explore integration possibilities with existing tools.
Investigate the limitations of current tools and how Dynatrace can complement or replace them.
10. Stakeholder Involvement
Questions to Ask:
Who are the key stakeholders involved in the monitoring process?
Development teams, DevOps engineers, network engineers, security teams, business owners.
What is the communication and escalation process?
How are incidents currently escalated and communicated across teams?
Key Areas to Investigate:
Define roles and responsibilities for monitoring, alerting, and incident management.
Ensure all relevant teams are aware of their part in maintaining the monitoring setup.
Conclusion
By asking these detailed questions and conducting a thorough discovery process, you can accurately define what needs to be monitored and ensure that your Dynatrace deployment covers all critical components of your application architecture and infrastructure. This process will help you build a tailored monitoring solution that provides actionable insights, ensuring optimal performance, availability, and scalability of your environment.
